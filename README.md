# collection-of-methods

A collection of methods I wrote for fun & practice. I'll keep updating this repository with new ones as I write them.

The majority of them are self-explanatory, so I will explain only the ones that aren't.

## Stocker Picker

Takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It returns a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

## Substrings

Takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings as the second argument. It returns a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
